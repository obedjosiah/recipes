PREPARATION METHOD
Season the chicken breasts to your taste preference and leave in the fridge to marinate for 30 - 45 minutes.
Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a frying pan or griddle pan if you choose to grill it and allow it to get very hot. Take the chicken breasts out of the fridge and place in the pan.
Allow it to sear for 2 minutes. 1 minute in, take a sharp knife and make incisions on the chicken breast to allow the heat to penetrate deep into the flesh. Give it another 2 - 3 minutes and the chicken should cook through completely.
Take the chicken breasts out of the hot pan and slice longitudinally on a chopping board, set aside and leave it to rest.
Slice and chop all the vegetables
Get your flat bread and place on foil paper
Lay over the vegetables, in whatever order you wish.
Place the sliced chicken breasts on top, scoop on Mayo and Ketchup and sprinkle on a little dry pepper
Roll the wrap gently.
Once rolled, wrap with the foil paper.
Place the wrap in the oven and let it grill for 5 minutes, or place the wrap in a dry frying pan and let it heat up for 5 minutes. Serve hot
